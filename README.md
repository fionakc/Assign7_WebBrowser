# Assign7_WebBrowser

This is a very basic web browser built using Android Studio. There are forward and back buttons, a home page, a history of pages visited, and the page will retain its memory of actions when the screen is rotated.

The url bar does not have the full functionality that a proper browser might in terms of abstract inputs.
