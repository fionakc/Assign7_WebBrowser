# Assign7_WebBrowser

With this assignment, we needed to create a web browser that used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
This web page will display a gallery of cat images, where selecting one of them will cause it to be enlarged onscreen.
The cat image files are bundled into the project, and their titles are read from a text document using PHP.
I challenged myself to create the most terrible 90s looking page that I could, hence the flashing and the colours and the font.
